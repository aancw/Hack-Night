# Requirements

In order to get the most out of Hack Night, we recommend participating in our interactive workshops. A few tools that will be necessary to set up before coming to Hack Night are [Python](https://python.org/downloads) and a virtualization program such as [VMware Workstation Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0) (if you have Windows), [VMware Fusion](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_fusion/8_0) (if you have Mac), or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Often when doing
cybersecurity related work, you will come across shady tools and software, as well as other potentially malicious files. For this reason we don't advise working on your host OS. We recommend installing [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) or [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) 14.04 LTS or 16.04 LTS on a virtual machine. 

> Little tip: NYU hosts their own [Ubuntu Mirror](http://mirror.es.its.nyu.edu/ubuntu-releases/) (might result in a faster download for some people).

Once you have setup your virtual machine, spend some time getting familiar with the command line, as this will be a very important skill as you progress in your career. Check out this neat [tutorial](http://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) as well as this quick [reference](https://github.com/momopranto/BTHS-Cybersecurity-Club/tree/master/2015-16/Workshops/Week3) to some basics.
