## Setup
In order to do most of the things talked about, you are going to need some sort of Linux virtual machine. First, if you don't already have one, you will need some sort of Virtual Machine software. We suggest either [VMware Player](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0) (preferable if you have Windows), [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) (preferable if you have a Mac), or [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (any operating system and free).

You will also need to download a linux distribution (our personal suggestion is [Kali Linux](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/), just pick the download for the software you have), and [here's some reading about Linux](http://lifehacker.com/5778882/getting-started-with-linux-the-complete-guide)).

You are going to want to learn a basic level of command line knowledge and for that you can check [this out](http://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/). If you want a more in depth tutorial check [this out](https://www.codeacademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line).
